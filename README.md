# GPT-4 Chat

This is a simple PHP boilerplate for sending instructions along with a message to GPT-4 and outputting the response in a browser. The project consists of two files:

- `index.php`: The main HTML file containing the chat UI.
- `gpt.php`: The PHP script that handles the chat logic and interacts with the GPT-4 API.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the two files.
2. Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` in `gpt.php` with your OpenAI API key.
3. Upload the files to your PHP-enabled web server.
4. Visit `index.php` in your browser to start the chat.
